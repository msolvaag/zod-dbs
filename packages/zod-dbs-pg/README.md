## Compatibility

This provider works with standard PostgreSQL and most managed PostgreSQL services. In many cases, no special configuration is required beyond a valid connection string.

- Works out of the box:
  - PostgreSQL (self-hosted), AWS RDS for PostgreSQL, Aurora PostgreSQL, GCP Cloud SQL for PostgreSQL, Azure Database for PostgreSQL
  - Neon, Supabase, Crunchy Bridge, Aiven, AlloyDB
  - Extensions like TimescaleDB and Citus

- Generally compatible (minor catalog differences may affect advanced features like enum detection):
  - CockroachDB (Postgres wire protocol)
  - YugabyteDB YSQL

- Not supported / limited for introspection:
  - Amazon Redshift (PG-like but diverged catalogs)
  - PG-wire systems that donâ€™t expose standard information_schema/pg_catalog

Tip: If your database speaks the PG wire protocol and exposes standard pg_catalog/info_schema (including pg_type/pg_enum), this provider should work. If those differ, some features may be limited.
